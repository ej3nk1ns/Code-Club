# Code-Club
Coding clubs using Scratch for schools

I have written some instructions for other people's projects, and some new projects with instructions, which I am publishing here.  The main site for Code club projects is https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects.  You can find implementations of all these projects at https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ej3nk1ns/, which you are free to remix and make your own.

Note that GitHub has issues rendering PDF files, so you may not be able to read these documents in the browser, but they will still download correctly.
