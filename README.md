# Code-Club
Coding clubs using Scratch for schools

I have written some instructions for other people's projects, and some new projects with instructions, which I am publishing here.  The main site for Code club projects is at https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/ (although you need to belong to a registered Code club to see them all).  You can find implementations of all these projects at https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ej3nk1ns/, which you are free to remix and make your own.
